/**
 * The screens this desktop asks a phone's shell to render from the app bundle instead of natively.
 *
 * One entry per route proved on the web, and the list is deliberately short: a route that is not
 * here renders the native screen, which is the state every phone is already in. Adding one is a
 * product decision with a device proof behind it, not a consequence of the bundle happening to
 * contain the module.
 *
 * `grants` names what the screen needs the shell to do for it. A shell that implements fewer than
 * an entry names renders the native screen for that route, so writing a grant here before the app
 * that implements it ships costs nothing and breaks nothing.
 *
 * Declared here rather than in src/shared because the builder is the only thing that reads it: the
 * shape it must satisfy is MobileWebBundleRouteSchema, which the manifest write is checked against.
 *
 * `haptics` is on every entry below, and by measurement rather than by habit: the shared worktree
 * row is in all five closures and calls the seam, so a route without the grant is a page whose taps
 * stop buzzing. mobile-web-app-haptics-seam.test.mjs derives that list from the closures and fails
 * on a route that imports the seam and declares nothing.

  // stack; `storage` for the shared components it renders; `externalLink` for the provider links
  // in its items, checks and drawers; `native.clipboard.write` for the two copy actions in its
  // comment review. Grants are scoped per route, so naming fewer here serves fewer.

  // The file explorer. `navigate` because its Back pops the native stack. `storage` for the shared
  // components the host layout renders above it.
  //
  // `externalLink` is transitive, not its own: a row opens the preview, and because that is a page
  // route and this list covers what it declares, the handoff keeps that push inside this document.
  // Grants are resolved once, from the route the shell opened (`grantsForRoute` on
  // `session.routePathname`), so a preview reached that way runs under *this* route's grants for
  // the life of the session. Covering the preview is therefore what buys the cheap in-document hop,
  // not what makes it correct: a target this list did not cover would be handed to the shell and
  // reopened under its own grants instead. The census beside it reads that relation off this list.
  //
  // Nothing the explorer itself renders opens a URL. The two openers in its own closure are the
  // shared layout's — the protocol wall, and the New Workspace source field the sidebar renders on
  // a wide layout — and every `/h` route reaches both, `/h/[hostId]` included, which declares no
  // `externalLink`. That tablet tap stays dead on all of them: a pre-existing gap this route
  // neither widens nor fixes.
  //
  // The sidebar `HostScreen` the layout renders on a wide layout pushes to `/h/<id>/tasks` from
  // every page route, and no other route declares the `native.clipboard.write` that one asks for.
  // The handoff gives that hop to the shell rather than keeping it here, which is why this list
  // does not grow a grant it has no screen for.

  // The file preview. Same three. `externalLink` is this route's own rather than inherited: a
  // Markdown preview renders links and `MobileMarkdown` opens them through the platform seam, which
  // is a consumer inside the domain rather than the shared wall. The explorer declares the same
  // list only because it can become this route in-page, so the two happen to be equal today and
  // the reasons are not.

  // `externalLink` for the three link openers in the PR segment — the checks list, the comment
  // markdown and the comment card; `native.clipboard.write` for the conflict section's copy button.
  //
  // `pr` and `history` are not listed and never will be. Both are `Redirect`s into this route, so
  // listing one would put a redirect inside a page whose session stays bound to the pathname it
  // left; left native they replace into this route and its switch opens the page once. The hop
  // census sees them as call sites naming `source-control`, never as targets of their own.

  // `externalLink` for the same PR sidebar, reached here through `MobileDiffReviewScreenView`;
  // `native.clipboard.write` for the send sheet's copy-notes action.
  //
  // Equal to the hub's on purpose rather than by coincidence. The two push into each other, and a
  // target declaring no more than its opener is a hop the handoff keeps inside the document — which
  // is why registering them together is what buys the cheap hop, and why the census beside this
  // list would show it the moment either grew a grant the other lacks.
