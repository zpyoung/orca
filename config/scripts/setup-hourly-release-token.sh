# A GitHub App is used rather than a PAT because its private key does not expire
# — no yearly rotation — and it belongs to the org rather than to the person who
# created it, so it survives that person leaving.

# The same App also serves adhoc-mac-build.yml and daily-mac-build.yml, which
# read these same two secrets: one credential, one rotation, all dev channels.
# Widening it to cover stablyai/orca-adhoc / orca-daily is
# setup-adhoc-release-repo.sh / setup-daily-release-repo.sh's job.

# The key is read from a file and piped straight into `gh secret set`. It is never
# echoed, never passed as a command-line argument (argv is world-readable via

Create a GitHub App (one time — the key never expires)
──────────────────────────────────────────────────────
  1. Open:  https://github.com/organizations/stablyai/settings/apps/new
  2. Name ..................  orca-hourly-release
     Homepage URL ..........  https://github.com/$HOURLY_REPO
     Webhook ...............  UNCHECK "Active"
  3. Repository permissions  ->  Contents: Read and write
     (leave everything else alone)
  4. "Where can this app be installed?"  ->  Only on this account
  5. Create, then note the App ID shown at the top of the page.
  6. Generate a private key (bottom of the page) — a .pem downloads.
  7. Install App  ->  Only select repositories  ->  $HOURLY_REPO
