# Agent session search contract

`AiVaultSearchRequest`, `AiVaultSearchResponse`, `AiVaultSearchHit`, and
`AiVaultSearchStatus` are defined in `src/shared/ai-vault-search-types.ts` and
validated by `src/shared/ai-vault-search-contract.ts`.

## Search and pagination

- Tool output beyond 3,072 characters per row is not indexed and not searchable; user and assistant text is indexed in full.
- A page cursor outstanding during a retention purge is refused once as `stale-cursor`; the client re-issues page 1.
- A phrase match across a chunk boundary of a long message is not supported.

`aiVault.searchSessions(request)` accepts `query`, optional `scope`
(`conversation` or `all`, default `all`), `freshness` (`indexed` or
`wait-until-current`, default `indexed`), `limit`, opaque `cursor`, `filters`,
and `debug` (default false). Conversation scope searches user and assistant text.
Filters accept `agents`, `scopePaths`, ISO `since`, and `sort` (`relevance` or
`newest`). Paths refer to the execution host and work for folders without Git.
Legacy `tier` and `refresh` fields are accepted and discarded; they do not change
the defaults. Limits use the engine's resolver: default 20, integers clamped to
1–100, fractional numbers use the default. Long queries reach the engine so it
can report truncation rather than fail validation.

Results contain `kind: 'results'`, `hits`, `page: { cursor, hasMore }`,
`generation`, `truncated: { candidates, snippets, query, freshness }`, and
`durationMs`. `snippets` is a count; the other truncation fields are booleans.
`durationMs` measures the engine search, excluding any reconciliation wait.
`debug: true` adds `debug: { route, repairedTerms?, plannerReport }`; the report
contains `route`, optional `repairedTerms`, and `scope`. Diagnostics never appear
at the top level. Status is never attached to search results.

A cursor belongs to one query and one host's index generation. Query, scope,
filters, and sorting must remain the same; page size may change. Writes that
advance the generation can invalidate it, including retention purges. A refused
cursor yields `{ kind: 'stale-cursor', generation, expectedGeneration? }` and the
client discards it and issues page 1 without a cursor. Reusing that refused cursor
continues to fail; there is no server-side cursor acknowledgement state.
Malformed cursors and cursors for a different query yield
`{ kind: 'malformed-cursor' }`. Generation checks also reject a first page if the
index changes during retrieval. Generation is a fence, not a retained snapshot:
a client cannot ask the host to recreate a previous generation.

Pages are per host only. Ordering is local to that host's query. Clients must
discard cursors when changing hosts. All-computers search, merged ordering,
per-host aggregate outcomes, and merged cursors are deferred to a separate PR.
That follow-up must define generation fencing, page-size changes, unavailable
hosts, and bounded parallel retrieval before exposing a combined result list.

## Execution host routing

Search and status address one execution host: `local`, `ssh:<target>`, or
`runtime:<environmentId>`. An omitted host means this desktop's local index.
Invalid IDs and `all` are refused; neither can widen a request to other hosts.

- `local` searches this machine's index over desktop IPC.
- `ssh:<target>` asks that relay session and nothing else.
- `runtime:<environmentId>` asks that paired runtime over its RPC. A paired
  runtime answers for itself and never forwards through another desktop.

Each hit may carry `executionHostId`. The desktop stamps remote answers with
the host it addressed rather than trusting an ID returned by that host.
Local answers and older hosts may omit attribution.

## Evidence and exposure

Each hit carries agent, session ID, title, cwd, branch, updated time, message
count, score, source, and evidence. Evidence contains snippet, role, and timestamp;
it is null for operator-only matches that have no text evidence. Snippet matches
use `[[` and `]]` markers. Source presence is `present`, `unverifiable`, or
`missing`; the current engine emits the first two. Loss of contact does not prove
a source missing.

`redactForTransport(hit, transport)` is the exposure policy:

| Transport                                 | filePath / codexHome                 | resumeCommand                     | Status `degradedRoots[].root` |
| ----------------------------------------- | ------------------------------------ | --------------------------------- | ----------------------------- |
| Desktop IPC on the same machine           | Included when known, under source    | Included only for present sources | Included                      |
| Runtime RPC on the same machine           | Included when known, under source    | Included only for present sources | Included                      |
| Relay or paired runtime/web/mobile client | Withheld; source keeps presence only | Withheld                          | Withheld                      |

`cwd`, titles, snippets, and other hit metadata remain visible to paired clients.
Snippets cross the authenticated transport as indexed; this contract does not
apply an observability redactor to transcript content. A missing Codex home is
omitted. Resume commands reuse the command stored by the transcript reader,
constructed by the sidebar's `buildAiVaultResumeCommand`; this layer does not
construct commands or execute them. The runtime uses its authenticated
`clientKind` context to distinguish paired clients from same-machine RPC, never
a request-supplied locality flag. The receiving remote client also applies the
same exposure function.

## Status, freshness, and availability

`aiVault.searchStatus()` returns `enabled`, `phase` (`idle`, `indexing`, `current`,
`degraded`, or `closed`), `filesIndexed`, `filesDue`, `filesFailed`, `degradedRoots`
(`root` and `reason`), `lastReconcileAt`, `lastSweepCompletedAt`, and `generation`.
Times are milliseconds since epoch or null. These are the indexer's observations;
an indexed row is not a new filesystem verification. A degraded root's `root` and
raw `reason` can both contain host filesystem paths. Desktop IPC and same-machine runtime RPC receive the full diagnostic;
relay and paired clients receive only the fixed reason "Source root could not
be verified." for each degraded root. The array length retains the count.

`wait-until-current` calls `service.reconcile()` before searching. The adapter
uses `indexer.reconcile({ full: false })`. After five seconds the endpoint searches
anyway and sets `truncated.freshness: true` on results. It does not cancel the
host's reconciliation. Completion before the deadline leaves the flag false;
a reconciliation error before the deadline propagates. The indexer's bounded
recent pass is not a promise that the entire historical corpus was swept.

Search unavailability is a value:
`{ kind: 'unavailable', reason: 'disabled' | 'not-ready' | 'no-service' }`.
No registered service returns `no-service`. Status without a service has
`enabled: false`, `phase: 'idle'`, zero counts and generation, empty degraded roots,
and null timestamps. This is a sentinel for an absent service, not a claim of an
empty, current index. A registered service may report disabled or not-ready.

## Boundaries and compatibility

- Desktop: `aiVault:searchSessions` and `aiVault:searchStatus`, via preload.
- Runtime and relay: `aiVault.searchSessions` and `aiVault.searchStatus`.
- Desktop preload optionally accepts an execution host scope as a separate
  routing argument. It addresses exactly that host; missing connections never
  fall back to the local index. The web preload addresses its own paired runtime,
  answers `all` and any other host with
  `unavailable/no-service` rather than an error.

Requests and responses are parsed where received from another process. Existing
relay JSON-RPC request/response framing needs no new stream opcode. Following the
existing relay method probe pattern, an old host's explicit `-32601` refusal (or
runtime `method_not_found`) maps to `unavailable/no-service` on the client; status
uses the absent-service sentinel above. Transport failures, authentication errors,
and invalid payloads remain errors. Unknown request fields are stripped for wire
compatibility.

The process-local `setSessionSearchService(service | null)` registry is the only
production seam in this PR. Tests use fake services and a real synthetic store.
Nothing constructs an engine or indexer in production. PR 3b owns process
lifecycle, consent/settings application, and registration of the production service.
