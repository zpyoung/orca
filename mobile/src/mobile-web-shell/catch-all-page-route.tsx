/**
 * Any host-scoped pathname this app has no route file for, handed to the shell.
 *
 * The only switch with no native screen behind it: a screen registered after this app shipped is in
 * the desktop's bundle and nowhere else, so `fallback` is a refusal rather than a panel. The
 * manifest still decides — the session reducer answers `native-route` for a pathname the bundle
 * does not list, and that answer lands on the same refusal.
 *
 * Least specific of everything in its directory, so it takes only what expo-router would otherwise
 * send to Unmatched; every route that has a file keeps it, on both platforms.
 *
 * Here and not in `app/`, with a one-line re-export there, because expo-router 55 reads a file's
 * platform from the first dot of its stripped name: `[...page]` already holds three, so
 * `[...page].web.tsx` under `app/` parses as platform `''` and registers a second route rather than
 * overriding this one. Metro and the page builder both resolve a `.web.tsx` sibling under `src/` by
 * stem, so the override belongs where the stem is plain.
 *
 * Each segment is re-encoded: `page` arrives decoded and split, and a `%2F` inside one segment
 * arrives as two.
