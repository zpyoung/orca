# Main RPC recordings

Test infrastructure only. `pilot-scenarios.json` binds logical operations/actions to small
mount adapters. The adapters execute the actual product modules from the selected source
root, using React's test renderer; they do not reconstruct acceptance or lifecycle logic.
The module loader transpiles the real source with TypeScript and resolves task barrels
lazily so unused native views do not need a device. Accessing an unspecified native import
fails. The history metadata function is exposed to its adapter without rewriting its body.

The transport reuses `createStableLogicalRpcClient`, `projectMobileRpcRequestParams`
(through that client), `RpcClientRequestTracker`, and the delivery-unknown marker. Hook
mounting follows `use-mobile-native-chat-file-search.test.ts`; physical session mounting
follows `stable-logical-rpc-client.test.ts`. Neither test exported a reusable mount utility.

## Scenario actions

```json
{"action":"mount","id":"mount"}
{"action":"query","id":"old-query","args":{"query":"old"}}
{"advance":120}
{"complete":"files.searchPaths#1","params":{"worktree":"id:A","query":"old","limit":16},"reply":{"ok":false,"error":{"code":"method_not_found","message":"Unknown method"}}}
{"bind":"old-inventory","request":"files.list#1","params":{"worktree":"id:A"}}
{"checkpoint":"pending"}
{"action":"select","id":"select-b","args":{"workspace":"B"}}
{"action":"select","id":"reset-a","args":{"workspace":"A"}}
{"complete":"old-inventory","params":{"worktree":"id:A"},"reply":{"ok":true,"result":{"files":[]}}}
{"checkpoint":"stale-completed"}
```

`{"$undefined":true}` in the input means explicit undefined, including an own property;
absence remains absence. Completion params are asserted against projected sender params.
Concurrent requests of one method require a logical binding and asserted params; random
wire ids never identify completions. Timers only advance explicitly, and zero-time drains
flush due timers, promise continuations, and React work after every step. Date, performance,
Math.random, Web Crypto random bytes/UUIDs, and transport ids are deterministic.

### Recorded time

Every settlement carries `startedAt` and `settledAt` in virtual milliseconds since the pinned epoch,
so the projection has a temporal dimension instead of relying on where a checkpoint happens to sit.
Any transition the product schedules for itself is recorded at the time it actually fires: change a
request deadline or the search debounce by any amount, in either direction, and a recorded number
moves. Granularity is exact milliseconds, because the fake timers fire at their scheduled time and
never coalesce; `recording-runner.test.ts` pins a 5 ms deadline settling at exactly `settledAt: 5`.

A checkpoint's own clock is not recorded. It is always the sum of the scripted `advance` steps, so
it is a function of the scenario rather than of the code under test; `run-recording.ts` asserts that
equality at every checkpoint instead, which costs no bytes and fails loudly if it ever drifts.

Recorded time covers thresholds the product schedules for itself. It cannot cover a threshold the
product only consults when something else makes it act, because no observation exists unless a
scenario acts inside the window. The `Date.now()` cache TTL in `use-host-repo-metadata.ts` is the
one such case here, so `settings-repo-cache-expiry` probes the cache at 59 s as well as at 60 s;
without the earlier probe a 20 s TTL and a 60 s TTL are both expired at 60 s and record identically.
That probe is coverage, not a substitute for recorded time: it bounds how small a TTL reduction is
visible, it does not make the reduction itself observable.

## Golden schema

Each file records `runnerVersion`, `baseline`, `lockfileSha256` (mobile's lockfile),
`recorderSha256`, `scenarioSha256`, `platform`, `scenarioVersion`, `projectionVersion`,
`goldenFormatVersion`, `operation`, `family`, and `namedDeltas`. `platform` and `lockfileSha256`
are provenance and are not compared: a dependency or OS that changes behaviour changes the trace
itself, so comparing them would only fail candidates on unrelated bumps. The rest are pinned.

`recorderSha256` covers every non-markdown file under this directory, so the runner that produced a
golden is as pinned as the product baseline: editing an adapter projection or a fixture fails
candidate mode on the header and forces a deliberate re-record of everything.

`scenarioSha256` covers the scenario input _that golden_ was recorded from — one manifest scenario
for a pilot golden, the generated variants and any hoisted prelude for a matrix or schedule golden,
canonicalised by `captureValue` so an explicit-undefined param stays distinct from an absent one.
Editing a scenario still fails candidate mode on the header, but only for the goldens derived from
it. The manifest used to be an input to `recorderSha256` instead, which made every golden's header
a function of every other family's scenarios: adding one domain's family re-digested all 153 files
and put a conflict on that line in every domain branch in flight. Which goldens a manifest derives
lives in `derived-goldens.ts`, so the digest is a function of the same derivation that records the
file rather than of a restatement of it; `golden-header-digest.test.ts` pins the four properties
that separation buys.

Checkpoints contain ordered sender calls and serialized physical application payloads, action and
request settlements, projected state, and ordered external effects. Sender args have three
positional slots; absent, undefined and null are distinct `$rpc` tags. Literal objects containing
`$rpc` are escaped. Only object keys are sorted; array/effect order, options, budgets, settlement
times and errors stay observable. Errors contain category, message and `isRpcDeliveryUnknown`, never
stack paths, plus `code` and a recursively captured `cause` when the thrown error carries them.
Platform is provenance; candidate comparison does not require the same operating system.

Format version 4 adds `scenarioSha256`. A version-3 golden would already fail this reader's byte
compare, so the bump buys the diagnosis rather than the rejection: `readGolden` names the stale
format and says to re-record, instead of reporting an opaque `(encoding)` difference. The bump moved
no observation.

### Value pool

Format version 3 stores each distinct observation _entry_ once under `values`, keyed by the first
12 hex of sha256 over the entry's sorted-key, whitespace-free JSON. `golden-value-pool.ts` declares
how each field interns rather than sniffing it from the value: `sender`, `payloads` and `effects`
are lists of pool hashes, `settlements` is a map from action id to a pool hash, and `state` is one
hash. A field recorded in a container its declaration does not name fails, so a projection change
cannot silently flip a field's encoding. Files stay pretty-printed; compact printing and recursive
interning of nested sub-values were measured and rejected.

Version 2 pooled each field _whole_, which stored the shared prefix of these append-only histories
once per checkpoint — and once per reply partition in a matrix golden. Interning per entry is a
pure re-encoding: the resolved `Recording` is unchanged, which is why the version bump moved no
observation. Over the 153 goldens it is 5.35 MB → 2.78 MB raw, and the pathological family
(`hostedReview.create-intent`, 12 sites over a 12-request chain) 2.0 MB → 792 KB.

It also makes a real diff smaller rather than larger, which is the opposite of what version 2's
note predicted. Adding a `timeoutMs` to the first `git.status` of the create-intent chain — an
early request every downstream checkpoint re-states — touches the same 16 files either way, but
under version 2 that is ±17,100 lines and 1.03 MB of diff, and under version 3 ±3,764 lines and
0.20 MB, because a moved entry no longer rewrites every field value that contains it.

`readGolden` refuses any other `goldenFormatVersion`, checks that every pooled entry hashes to its
own key and that no entry sits in the pool unreferenced — content addressing is what keeps an entry
shared across checkpoints honest, and an unread entry would be content in the file that nothing
compares. It then resolves hashes back to values, and `compareGolden` reports the scenario, the
checkpoint id, the field, the JSON path inside it, and both resolved values.

### Prelude checkpoints

A generated variant declares the index where its distinguishing input lands. Checkpoints before
that index observe steps identical to the base, so `hoistPreludeCheckpoints` records them once in
a `<base>.prelude` scenario and starts each variant at its own divergence; it asserts each
variant's pre-divergence prefix matches the base. Reply matrices, interruption schedules and
lifecycle schedules use it. Checkpoints that merely happen to be equal are never merged: reaching
the same state through different inputs is evidence. Sibling schedules already drop their shared
prefix, so they are unchanged.

Nothing about a shared prelude is unverified. The `.prelude` scenario's checkpoints live in the same
golden as the variants that start after them, and `compareGolden` walks every checkpoint in the
file, so changing the prelude fails the golden it belongs to. The value pool does not weaken that:
it is per-file and content-addressed, so a prelude entry a later checkpoint re-states is stored once
and any change to it moves the hash in every checkpoint that reads it.

Family matrices and schedule recordings retain both boundaries. Matrices execute
raw reply partitions at the scripted sender port; they do not claim malformed-frame coverage
through direct/relay frame validation. Caches
are tested by follow-up requests; no private cache maps are inspected.

Every family runs the eleven partitions in `reply-matrix.ts` at **every reply its base scenario
scripts**, one golden per site, and nothing is crossed against consumed fields. The partitions are
the reply shapes a host can send: a normal result, an absent result, `null`, an inner `{ok: false}`
envelope with a string or object error, an inner envelope missing `ok`, an outer refusal with and
without a message, `method_not_found`, and a transport rejection with and without a message. Shapes
that were recorded before and are gone were unreachable: `successResponse` always sets `result`, so
JSON carries no explicit-undefined slot, and no mounted method's handler returns a number, a string,
an array, a bare `{}`, or a boolean. `null` stays because `linear.getIssue` returns it for a missing
issue and the b2 seed is a shipped null-result bug.

The message-less refusal and rejection are what separate the two failure paths a migrated call site
must keep apart: a refusal with no message falls back to the screen's copy, a transport drop with no
message surfaces its empty message verbatim. With only the message-carrying shapes both produce the
same text, so collapsing the two catches is invisible. Every source-control family used to carry a
hand-written `*-empty-message` scenario for exactly that; the partition carries it now.

### Which request a matrix drives

All of them. Selecting one per family was a hardcoded prefix list, and it silently `continue`d past
any family it did not name — ten of twenty-three, every family the source-control migration added,
which is why that migration's mutation evidence came down to single hand-written scenarios.
`replyMatrixSites` takes every completion step in the family's base scenario instead: no judgement
about which request is the "real" one, and no edit when a domain is added. A family that scripts no
reply at all throws, and a repeated request name throws, because the divergence would be ambiguous.

A variant answers its own site differently, so the replies scripted after it may never be asked
for. Those steps are marked `optional` and are answered only if the request is outstanding; the
sender list in each checkpoint records which ones the operation actually sent.

The `normal` partition replays a result the family already records for that request — the first
fulfilled reply in scenario order, base first — so no migrator invents a plausible payload per
domain. `null` and absent do not count, because each is already a partition of its own and
replaying one would leave the site with no success control. A site whose family records no other
success fails the suite until it is given a fulfilled scenario or a line in
`REPLY_MATRIX_NORMAL_RESULT_INVENTORY`, which carries the reply and the reason; an entry whose
family has since recorded a success fails too, so the list only shrinks. Four sites are on it: both
legs of the b3 seed, whose single scenario exists to record the defect; the b2 seed, whose only
recorded success is the shipped null result; and `settings.update`, a best-effort write whose reply
body no call site reads.

Detached unhandled rejections are captured as effects in a sequential process-scoped window,
with prior process listeners restored afterward. The known main bug it first recorded is fixed on
both legs: `new-workspace-runtime-context-null-results-degrade-to-absent` now records a null or
absent `settings.get` or `ui.get` result degrading the way a reply missing that member does, so
neither matrix golden carries a property-read TypeError effect any more. That leaves no golden
recording an unhandled rejection at all, so `unhandled-recording.test.ts` is what pins the capture:
without it a refactor could stop emitting the effect and every golden would still compare clean.
Task-model projections record setter invocations and resulting model values, not native UI.

## Commands and checker contract

Record only from unchanged pinned product sources and lockfile. The fence exempts only
`mobile/src/test-support/rpc-recording`, which `recorderSha256` pins instead; every other
test-support path is compared against the baseline like product code:

```sh
ORCA_BACKGROUND_LAUNCH=1 RPC_FOUNDATION_RECORD=1 pnpm --dir mobile exec tsx scripts/rpc-recording.mts --record
ORCA_BACKGROUND_LAUNCH=1 pnpm --dir mobile test src/test-support/rpc-recording
```

Mutants are the defect evidence. `operation-mutations.ts` holds one anchored source edit per
adapter family, and every family's recording must change visible state when its mutant is applied,
which is what shows that family's `state()` projection observes the operation's real output.
Anchors are asserted to match exactly one site, because a repeated anchor would half-apply while
still counting as applied. Mutants replace the expression in memory, then run the same real hook.
`runRecordingMutant` accepts a mutated mounting adapter, scheduler, baseline and optional
observation projection, and returns `{verdict: "killed" | "survived", recording}`. Every mutant
test requires the mutation to apply exactly once and change visible state to count as killed.

Set `RPC_FOUNDATION_REFERENCE_ROOT` to an archived `bcba08b3e4` source tree to corroborate the
three B-seed mutants against the real defect; the reference checkout is never edited. Each seed
pins the archived tree's visible state, so a later refactor of those files cannot pass by merely
differing from main. Archived-tree corroboration for b1/b2/b3 is **unproven in CI**:
CI does not set `RPC_FOUNDATION_REFERENCE_ROOT`. These three checks remain opt-in; the
in-memory mutant checks run in CI. No archived-tree checks are registered for other
families because no reference states are defined for them.

## What this oracle does and does not see

It replays 78 scenarios against frozen goldens and fails on any divergence: 153 goldens over 210
tests, all inside `pnpm --dir mobile test`. For a migration it answers one question — does the
rewritten call site produce the same sender calls, settlements, state and effects as main did?

It is not a substitute for reading the diff. Three facts bound it, all learned the hard way:

- **It was blind to refusal ordering.** Reordering the settings and sibling refusal checks in
  `mobile-new-tab-agent-loader.ts` survives every golden except `probe-new-tab-both-refused` —
  measured by applying the reorder to the real source: 1 failure in 84 tests, and the one failure
  is a probe. Every pre-probe "refused" scenario refuses on the _first_ request, and every
  correlated-failure schedule rejects at the transport, where neither check is reached. A human
  reviewer caught that class by reading #20499.
- **It did not observe data loss on refresh.** No pre-probe golden records state after a refused
  _refresh_, so "does this screen keep its data or blank it?" was undocumented. This one is an
  observational gap, not a proven detection gap: publishing an unaccepted read in
  `use-new-workspace-runtime-context.ts` is caught by the refuse-after-data probe _and_ by
  `matrix-settings.workspace-context`, because a refusal from cold publishes `null` over a non-null
  initial value. Claim the recorded behaviour, not blindness.
- **It was blind to whatever the matrix skipped.** While the driven request came from a hardcoded
  prefix list, moving `readMobileHostedReviewGitStatus`'s `interpret` into the request chain — which
  turns a transport rejection into an `{ok: false}` result instead of letting it propagate — survived
  all 163 tests, because no scenario rejected `git.status` for that family. Driving every scripted
  reply kills it on five matrix goldens. The lesson is about the skip, not about that call site: a
  generator that opts a family out without failing is indistinguishable from coverage.

`probe-hole-witness.test.ts` closes the first two and keeps them closed. It asserts the hole and the closure
together: each probe must kill its mutation _and_ every pre-probe scenario of the same operation
must still survive it. A probe that stops being load-bearing fails instead of lingering.

What is still not covered: what the count-based raw-port inventory covers instead (which files
reach `sendRequest`, and how often), native storage, transport skew, the `subscribe`/
`sendUnsubscribe` ports, and the two mutations under _Known-open holes_ below. Four of the nine
probes pin behaviour with no demonstrated mutation — the two mixed reject/refusal new-tab orders
and the home-providers and resume-metadata refresh refusals; they are frozen observations, not
proven defect detectors. `settings.resume-metadata` projects `{}` as its state, so its probe
observes only sender calls and settlements.

### Recorded finding: a refused refresh is not handled the same way twice

The five refuse-after-data probes record a `settings.get` read refusing a _refresh_ after a
success: home providers and task hydration read through `settingsRead`, workspace context, resume
metadata and repo metadata through `optionalSettingsRead`. Which one a site uses does not change
what these probes record — the two share an acceptance and differ only in how they read a null
result, and a refusal never reaches the reader. Four call sites retain what they had.
`use-mobile-tasks-runtime-hydration.tsx` does not: it publishes `{}`, so a refused refresh wipes
the runtime task settings. That divergence is recorded, not repaired —
`settings-task-hydration-refuse-after-data.json` is the observation, and changing the behaviour is
a product change with its own re-record.

### Running it for a step-4 migration

```sh
# 1. Before touching the call site, confirm the oracle is green on your branch.
ORCA_BACKGROUND_LAUNCH=1 pnpm --dir mobile test src/test-support/rpc-recording

# 2. Migrate the call site. Re-run. Any divergence is your diff, reported down to the JSON path.

# 3. If a divergence is intended, say so deliberately. Recording refuses to run unless the
#    product tree matches the pinned baseline, so bump `baseline` in pilot-scenarios.json to the
#    commit you are recording from first.
ORCA_BACKGROUND_LAUNCH=1 RPC_FOUNDATION_RECORD=1 \
  pnpm --dir mobile exec tsx scripts/rpc-recording.mts --record
```

A re-record is a claim about behaviour. State the cause in the commit; every golden the refresh
moves should have one.

Editing the recorder itself on a migration branch is the awkward case: `recorderSha256` moves, so
every golden needs rewriting, but the product tree no longer matches `baseline`, and bumping
`baseline` to the branch would record the migrated source and make the parity claim circular. Record
from the pinned commit instead, with this branch's recorder laid over it — a detached checkout or a
`git archive` extraction of `baseline`, this tree's `rpc-recording/` and `pilot-scenarios.json`
copied in, `node_modules` symlinked, `RPC_FOUNDATION_GOLDENS` pointed at a scratch directory — then
copy the result back and run the candidate suite here. Format the recorder before recording: an
`oxfmt` pass afterwards moves `recorderSha256` again.

If your call site carries a mutation anchor in `operation-mutations.ts`, rewriting it will make the
anchor match zero sites. Re-anchor the same defect at its new home rather than deleting the mutant:
#20499 broke five anchors that way, and each one had a new home.

`live-probe/` holds the runtime companion: `mock-desktop-settings-reply-modes.patch` teaches the
mock desktop server to answer `settings.get` with a refusal, `method_not_found`, a null or absent
result, absent settings, or silence, and `settings-get-reply-probe.mts` drives a real socket
through the migrated acceptance layer. Opt-in, never applied by the suite, because the patch is a
product-tree edit.

## Known-open holes

Two behavioural mutations are not caught by any golden. Both were confirmed by mutating product
source and re-deriving the whole suite; neither is reachable through the adapters as they stand,
so closing them needs new adapter capability rather than another scenario. Anyone migrating these
call sites should not assume the recordings will notice a change here:

- **`use-host-repo-metadata.ts` cross-module cache write.** Deleting `setCachedRepos(...)` survives.
  No adapter mounts `useNewWorkspaceRepositories`, which is the consumer that reads that cache to
  open workspace creation without waiting, so the write has no observer. Closing it needs a
  cache-consumer mount after the metadata fetch.
- **`use-pr-bot-author-overrides.ts` client-identity guard.** Forcing
  `sourceClientRef.current !== client` to `false` survives. The adapter closes over one client
  object: `reset` changes only the refresh key, `cutover` migrates the same stable logical client,
  and remounting discards the old hook state. Closing it needs a same-mount client replacement.

The original settings slice coverage maps nine host-RPC callers in
`settings-recording-coverage.json`; device-preference entries are excluded by coordinator
instruction. Later manifest additions require new scenarios and remain uncovered until
those recordings land. This runner does not certify native storage or transport skew.

## The cleanup checkpoint

Teardown runs on the recorded path, not only in `finally`. Each checkpoint clones the effects
array, so a rejection or state write produced by `dispose()`, the transport teardown or the final
`scheduler.flush()` used to land after the recording was built and never reached a golden — and an
unmount leak is exactly what this oracle exists to catch.

When teardown observes anything, it becomes a checkpoint with id `cleanup`. `state` is captured
before dispose, because the operation is gone afterwards.

Five goldens carry one today, covering six scenarios whose dropped observations were not noise:
`projectRowDetailError`, `projectMutating`, `hostLabelById`, `hostPlatform`, `workspaceAgent`,
`workspaceAgentOverridden`, `creatingKey`, `selectedAgent`, `agentOverridden` and `error`. A
scenario that stops leaking loses its checkpoint, which is a visible golden diff rather than a
silent improvement.
