/**
 * Only shapes a host can send. `successResponse` always sets `result`, so an absent key means the
 * handler returned undefined and there is no explicit-undefined shape on a JSON wire; `null` is a
 * real result (`linear.getIssue` on a missing issue, and the b2 seed). The GitHub project
 * mutations carry an inner `{ok, error}` envelope whose error is a string or an object. Everything
 * else a client sees is the dispatcher refusing, not knowing the method, or the transport failing.
 *
 * Refusal and rejection each appear twice, once with a message and once without. A message is what
 * separates the two failure paths a migrated call site has to keep apart: a refusal with none falls
 * back to the screen's copy, a transport drop with none surfaces its empty message verbatim. With
 * only the message-carrying shapes both paths produce the same text, and collapsing them is
 * invisible — which is why every source-control family had a hand-written `*-empty-message`
 * scenario. The partition carries that instead of each migrator remembering to write one.

 * the matrix without saying so, and there is no property of a scenario that identifies the "real"
 * request — the settings families answer prerequisites before their own read, the chains answer
 * their own steps in order. Driving every completion needs no such judgement and needs no edit when
 * a domain is added. A family that scripts no reply at all cannot be matrixed and throws.
