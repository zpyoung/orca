# Orca Heimdall

This discovery stub loads the version-matched guide from the Orca executable used for this session.

Use Orca's `heimdall` CLI to observe and manage the watcher fleet: list and inspect watchers,
create objective or hosted-review watchers, approve or answer escalations, adjust budgets, steer
workers, pause, resume, disarm, or remove a watcher. Management commands can target remote-owned
watchers through the fleet row's recorded owner; create enrolls only on a workspace local to the
selected runtime, so connect directly to another owner rather than relying on a fallback. Start by
reading the full guide before acting.
