// Why: after the first-work branch+display rename, the worktree's on-disk folder
// still carries its creature name (e.g. `cunner`), which is confusing once the
// branch reads `worktree-creation-spinner`. This module aligns the folder with
// the new branch leaf via `git worktree move`, then migrates Orca's path-derived
// worktree identity so meta, tabs, and the live PTY session carry over. It is
// best-effort and local-only — remote/Windows/locked/dest-taken all degrade to
// "folder kept" without disturbing the rename that already succeeded.
