  // or refreshing the retry.

  cliCommand?: OrchestrationCliCommand
  // Why: populated by the coordinator's dispatch pre-flight (§3.1) only
  // when the target worktree is behind its tracking remote. When absent
  // or when `behind === 0`, the preamble emits no drift section. Callers
  // must NOT pre-populate this with empty data; the drift section is a
  // loud-but-rare signal tied to the `allow-stale-base: true` override
  // path, and polluting it for fresh worktrees would train workers to
  // ignore it.

// not as a separate prose block — LLM readers anchor on examples and skim
// trailing prose, so rules must land at the point of use.

=== CLI COMMANDS ===

  # Report the terminal task outcome (REQUIRED exactly once).
  #
  # RULE: --body must be a 3-sentence executive summary (what you did,
  # what you found, what's left). Never send an empty body; the coordinator
  # reads the body first and only opens artifacts if it needs more detail.
  # If you produced a long-form artifact, include its path as
  # payload.reportPath so the coordinator can find it without a file search.
  #
  # RULE: send worker_done exactly once. Use --outcome succeeded when the
  # requested work is done, or replace it with --outcome failed when it is not.
  # Never encode failure only in prose and never silently exit.
  # Include BOTH taskId and dispatchId in the payload so a late completion
  # from a failed retry cannot complete the current dispatch.
  ${cli} orchestration send --from ${params.workerHandle}${capabilityFlag} \\
    --type worker_done --subject "<short status>" \\
    --body "<3-sentence summary: what you did, what you found, what's left>" \\
    --task-id ${params.taskId} --dispatch-id ${params.dispatchId} --outcome succeeded \\
    --files-modified "path/a,path/b" \\
    --report-path "<optional: path to the full artifact>"

  # BEHAVIOR RULE: send a heartbeat every ${HEARTBEAT_INTERVAL_MIN} minutes
  # while actively working on the task. The coordinator uses this to
  # distinguish "still thinking" from "hung / crashed." Skip heartbeats only
  # while blocked inside \`check --wait\` or \`ask\` — those calls are
  # themselves liveness signals.
  #
  # Include BOTH taskId and dispatchId in the payload: the coordinator
  # attributes the heartbeat to the specific dispatch context, not just
  # the task, so a straggler heartbeat from a previously-failed dispatch
  # cannot mask a hung retry.
  ${cli} orchestration send --from ${params.workerHandle}${capabilityFlag} \\
    --type heartbeat --subject "alive" \\
    --task-id ${params.taskId} --dispatch-id ${params.dispatchId} \\
    --phase "<short: investigating|implementing|reviewing|waiting>"

  # Ask the coordinator a question and block until it answers.
  #
  # BEHAVIOR RULE #1 (MUST NOT VIOLATE):
  # NEVER use AskUserQuestion; use \`${cli} orchestration ask\` or send
  # --type decision_gate. AskUserQuestion opens a local TUI prompt that the
  # coordinator cannot see and cannot answer — your session will hang forever
  # waiting on a human. Every interactive question goes through \`ask\` below.
  #
  # The \`ask\` verb durably records a question in this Dispatch's Run and
  # blocks until the coordinator replies, then prints the reply body. If the
  # call times out or disconnects, resume with the returned message ID instead
  # of creating a duplicate question.
