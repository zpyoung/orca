/**
 * Names the global update command can actually converge.
 *
 * Eligibility is decided purely over the placements that command touches — the
 * canonical copy and its symlink aliases. Copies it provably leaves alone (standalone
 * duplicates, project skills, plugin caches, links out of tree) neither authorize an
 * update nor withhold one: the badge would otherwise promise work the command cannot
 * do, or refuse work it could, over a copy that is never at stake either way. A
 * blocked *convergent* copy still withholds it, because that is the placement the
 * command would write to and overwriting it is the real data-loss case.
 * `globallyUpdatableNames` comes from the updater's lock; an unregistered copied
 * bundle is installed but `skills update` cannot identify its source.
