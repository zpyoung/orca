 * Auto-focuses the rich markdown editor on mount so users can start typing

 * from modals/dialogs and skips scrollIntoView to avoid racing with
 * useEditorScrollRestore.
 *
 * `force` marks an explicit user handoff (Explorer open): it bypasses the theft
 * guard and claims DOM focus in this tick, because `commands.focus()` defers the
 * real `view.focus()` by a further frame. `shouldFocus` lets the caller retire a
 * handoff that expired while the frame was pending.
