// Shared LRU bound for the native-chat composer's per-scope caches (draft text
// and image attachments), both keyed by stable pane identity. The
// caches exist so an in-progress message survives the composer unmounting on a
// TUI/GUI toggle, but a scope key for a permanently-removed pane is never
// revisited, so without a bound its unsent entry would linger for the renderer's
// whole session. delete-then-set keeps the actively-edited scope most-recent so
// eviction only sheds the oldest untouched scopes.
