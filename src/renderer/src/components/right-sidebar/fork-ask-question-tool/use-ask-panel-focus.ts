 * Points the right sidebar at the Questions panel while the focused session has an unanswered
 * ask, and gives it back when the ask resolves.
 *
 * The override is layered over the routed tab rather than written to `rightSidebarTab` on
 * purpose: that field is persisted and mirrored to paired mobile/web clients, and the sidebar
 * already renders a fallback for a hidden tab "without overwriting the stored route"
 * (use-right-sidebar-tab-routing.ts). Leaving the stored route alone makes the hand-back exact
 * and free — once the item is gone the routed tab is whatever the user last chose.
 *
 * Must be called on the routing hook's *result*, never inside it: that hook copies its own
 * effective tab into the folder-workspace memory, which `'ask'` has no business entering.
