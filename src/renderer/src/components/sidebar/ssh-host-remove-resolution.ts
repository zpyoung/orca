 * Classifies what removing an SSH target means for the workspaces still on it,

 *  - connected  → can delete host AND its remote worktrees (real git removal)
 *  - offline    → target still configured but not connected; delete would need a
 *                 reconnect, so default to forgetting the workspaces locally
 *  - (no workspaces) → plain host removal, no workspace decision needed
