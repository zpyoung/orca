 *  - 'forget-local': the host is offline/gone, so only clear Orca's records —
 *    no remote files, worktrees, or branches are touched.

 * Worktrees are removed before their root repos so a root removal never races a
 * still-registered child. Failures are collected (not thrown) so the caller can
