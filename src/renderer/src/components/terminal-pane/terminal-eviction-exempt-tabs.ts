 * a split tab whose SECOND leaf holds the unrestorable PTY fails coverage (and
 * so becomes a retention candidate) yet would otherwise look exempt-free and
 * unmount, orphaning that live shell. tab.ptyId stays in the union in case pane
 * resolution misses it (no layout, no capture).
 *
 * Accepted residual: detection is per pane but retention is per TAB — the whole
 * PaneManager stays mounted, so one exempt leaf also pins its restorable split
 * siblings, and the retention budget cannot bound exempt tabs. Capping them is
 * not an option (eviction orphans the live shell); the real fix is making those
 * pty classes reattachable. Sibling TABS are unaffected — the worktree-level
 * veto was removed (selectRetentionForceParkedTerminalWorktrees never consults
 * tab exemptions).
