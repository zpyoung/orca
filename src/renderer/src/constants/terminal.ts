// Why: mobile wake (experimental agent sleep) must fire the cold-restore
// --resume of a worktree's mounted hidden hibernated panes without a desktop
// hidden→visible reveal. Each mounted TerminalPane self-selects on this event
// by worktreeId and invokes its own armed hibernation wake — a fanout, since
// pane bindings are per-instance with no global registry.
export const WAKE_HIBERNATED_AGENTS_WORKTREE_EVENT = 'orca-wake-hibernated-agents-worktree'

// Why: sidebar open/close is an instantaneous width change. If we wait for
// the ResizeObserver rAF (and the 150ms debounced global fit) to catch up,
// the user sees the terminal in a wrongly-fit state for ~16ms+ then a snap
// as it reflows. Dispatching this event in a useLayoutEffect lets the
// terminal fit synchronously before paint — so the new width and the
// reflowed terminal land on the same frame with no visible transient.
//
// Continuous drags (sidebar-width drag, tab-group split drag) use the
// per-pane ResizeObserver path instead.
