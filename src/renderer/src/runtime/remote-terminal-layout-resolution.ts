/**
 * Single source of truth for turning a set of terminal leaves into a layout
 * tree on the client. The host's published layout is authoritative; this module
 * exists so every client ingestion path resolves the tree the same way instead
 * of independently re-deriving it (which is how "Split Right" used to render as
 * a down split — divergent fallbacks each guessed a direction).
 *
 * Invariant: NEVER invent a split direction. A split's direction is meaningful
 * user/host state, so a guessed direction is wrong by construction. When no
 * authoritative tree covers the leaves, we keep whatever covering tree we do
 * have, and only as a true last resort synthesize a degenerate chain — logged
 * so the gap is visible rather than silently masquerading as a real layout.
