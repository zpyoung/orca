/** Split a cross-host reorder permutation into per-host permutations.

 * Why: each host persists only its own repos and rejects any id list that is not
 * a full permutation of that host's repos (persistence.ts#reorderRepos). So a
 * single combined id list can only be applied on the host that owns every id —
 * never the case once repos span hosts. We instead group ids by their owner host
 * (preserving the user's relative order within each host) and dispatch one
 * permutation per host. Repos without an explicit owner fall back to the focused
 * host, matching the rest of the owner-routing helpers.
