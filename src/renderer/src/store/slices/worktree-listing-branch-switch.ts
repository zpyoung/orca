/**
 * Route branch switches observed by a worktree-listing refresh through
 * `updateWorktreeGitIdentity` before the listing is merged into the store.
 *
 * Why: a terminal branch switch is observed by two independent refresh paths —
 * the git-status identity path (which clears branch-scoped review links) and
 * the worktree-listing path (which rehydrates persisted metadata, including a
 * now-stale linked PR, alongside the new branch). If the listing merge lands
 * first, the identity path sees no branch change and never clears, leaving
 * Checks pinned to the previous branch's PR. Applying the identity update
 * first makes the link clear happen no matter which path wins the race.
 *
 * Only entries that still carry branch-scoped review context are routed: when
 * there is nothing to clear the plain merge already applies the new branch,
 * and skipping the rest preserves the stale-refetch protection where an old
 * listing row must not roll back a newer branch identity.
