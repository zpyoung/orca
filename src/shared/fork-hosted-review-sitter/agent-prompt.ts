MAY
- Apply mechanical lint and format fixes.
- Adapt code to an upstream API whose shape changed, while preserving behavior.
- Fix the actual defect demonstrated by the failing check or merge conflict.

ESCALATE
- Stop without making further changes when a correct fix would remove or materially change behavior.
- Stop when the evidence does not clearly permit the change under the MAY list.
- Leave all existing files and changes in place when escalating; do not reset, clean, or delete them.

NEVER
- Skip, delete, disable, focus, or narrow a test to make it pass.
- Add a lint/type-check disable, suppression comment, ignore rule, or per-file baseline exception.
- Weaken, bypass, or remove any CI gate.
- Dismiss a failure as pre-existing or flaky without provider evidence.
- Do not amend, reset, rebase, push, force-push, or otherwise publish. An unattended preparation may create its one required local commit; that commit is not publication.`
