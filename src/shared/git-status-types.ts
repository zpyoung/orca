// fallback, not a semantic claim). However, such consumers must NOT offer
// file-existence-dependent affordances (diff loading, drag payloads, editable-
// file opening) for entries where `conflictStatus === 'unresolved'` — the file
// may not exist on disk (e.g. both_deleted). This affects file explorer
// decorations, tab badges, and any surface outside Source Control.
//
// `conflictStatusSource` is never set by the main process. The renderer stamps
// 'git' for live u-records and 'session' for Resolved locally state.
