 *
 * Why bracketed paste: agent launch prompts are single-quoted, but their
 * literal embedded newlines survive quoting. bash readline / zsh zle read every
 * raw LF as accept-line (Enter), so the first newline inside a multiline prompt
 * submits an unterminated single-quoted command and drops the shell into PS2
 * continuation — the prompt is executed piecemeal and mangled. Wrapping the
 * payload in bracketed-paste markers (ESC[200~ … ESC[201~) tells the line
 * editor to insert the whole multiline text literally; only the trailing CR/LF
 * written after the end marker submits it. Single-line commands keep the proven
 * raw-write path unchanged so the fast path never regresses.
